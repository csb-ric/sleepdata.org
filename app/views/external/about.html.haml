    The National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR) offers free access to large
    collections of de-identified physiological signals and clinical data
    elements collected in well-characterized research cohorts and clinical

    Members can contribute their own data and tools for sharing, provide
    information and feedback on ways to improve sleep and physiological signal
    data exchange and analysis, and offer ideas on how to make NSRR and other
    resources work best for the scientific community.

      PhysioNet
    provides access to large and diverse collections of recorded physiologic
    signals (PhysioBank) and related open-source software (PhysioToolkit).
    PhysioBank currently includes over 200 annotated polysomnograms in 4
    collections, and more than 60 other databases, including the MIMIC and MIMIC
    II Waveform and Clinical Databases collected from over 30,000 ICU patients,
    and a wide range of specialized data sets from clinical and research
    studies.

      National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Biologic Specimen and
      Data Repository
    is the coming together of two entities: the NHLBI Biologic Specimen
    Repository (NHLBI Biorepository), managed by the NHLBI, Division of Blood
    Diseases and Resources (DBDR), Transfusion Medicine and Cellular
    Therapeutics Branch, and the NHLBI Data Repository, managed by the NHLBI,
    Division of Prevention and Population Sciences (DPPS), Epidemiology Branch.
    These two programs have always had a similar mission, namely to enhance and
    facilitate further research in cardiovascular, pulmonary and hematologic
    conditions by providing access to qualified investigators to stored
    biospecimen and data collections.
