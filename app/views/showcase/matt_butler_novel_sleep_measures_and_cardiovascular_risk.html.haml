    Today, the NSRR team is taking a moment to discuss the latest sleep
    research with Matt Butler.
    Thank you Matt for providing us with insight into your research!

        Circadian disruptions and sleep disorders alter temporal patterns of
        physiology and behavior, and they increase the risk for cardiovascular
        disease, metabolic diseases including diabetes, and mood disorders. At
        the Oregon Institute of Occupational Health Science, my laboratory's
        goals are to determine the mechanisms by which this occurs through
        controlled physiology experiments (basic and clinical) as well as
        through prospective analyses in long term human sleep study cohorts.

        As a postdoctoral fellow in Steven Shea's laboratory at the Brigham
        and Women's Hospital, I found a circadian rhythm in the duration of
        apneas and hypopneas. This largely explains the common observation
        that respiratory events get longer through the night. This led
        naturally to the question of whether long or short apneas are bad for
        health. We approached Dr. Redline about answering this, and by chance,
        this coincided closely with the launch of the National Sleep Research
        Resource (NSRR). I became an NSRR early adopter: I provided feedback
        on my experiences with the NSRR and the

        data as I worked on the preliminary analyses that led to this grant
        award from the American Sleep Medicine Foundation.

        Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder which
        increases the risks for cardiovascular disease. Currently, it is
        diagnosed by the mean number of events per hour of sleep
        (apnea-hypopnea index, AHI). This metric fails to capture the wide
        variability in the severity and timing of events, and importantly, it
        is a poor predictor of risk in women. We used the NSRR to examine the
        overnight sequence of events and the health outcomes for subjects in
        the Sleep Heart Health Study, and we found that event duration
        predicts mortality

        We are now testing whether event
        duration can outperform AHI in predicting risk, especially in women.
        Concurrently, we are investigating the information provided by the
        clustering of events in time, as the intervals between events can vary
        dramatically, even for a particular AHI

      Decile plot (cross hatches show 10% intervals) of the inter-event
      interval (IEI) distribution for 8 subjects with AHI of 40-41. The IEI
      coefficient of variation (IEI-CV) varied from 0.4 to 3.6. The two left
      subjects have a maximum IEI of ~2 min, whereas the two right subjects
      have a maximum IEI of >10 min and ~25% of all intervals are >2min.
