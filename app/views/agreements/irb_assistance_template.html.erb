    Basic Information On Submitting a Proposed NSRR Project to Your Local IRB
  </h2>
</div>


<p class="lead-paragraph">
  We are required to obtain evidence that your project/purpose has been <strong><i><u>reviewed</u></i></strong> by your local IRB/Ethics Committee. Most local IRB reviews will likely result in a <u>Determination Letter</u> stating the proposed research/project is exempt due to:
</p>

<p class="lead-paragraph">
  <ul>
    <li>not meeting the criteria/definition of Human Subject Research; and</li>
    <li>no direct or indirect contact with an individual or interpersonal contact with an individual; and</li>
    <li>the information obtained from the activity cannot be linked, or associated to a particular individual, and</li>
    <li>the identity of the person may not be ascertained by the investigator under 45 CFR46 or 21 CFR 56.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p class="lead-paragraph">
  We suggest you file a request for determination giving the description of your project along with the following information about the NSRR site â€“ noting that all data available on the site has been de-identified.
</p>

<p class="lead-paragraph">
  The National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR) site is a comprehensive easily accessible, well-annotated national repository of de-identified sleep data, including bio-physiological signals, which are linked to risk factor and outcome data for participants in major National Institute of Health studies. Also available to the research community on the site are data integration and signal processing tools. (<%= link_to SITE_URL, SITE_URL %>)
  If your submission results in a letter or memo from the IRB/Ethics Committee stating they determined this is not human research and does not require further IRB review, we will accept that letter/memo. Attach that document to the signed DAUA and access will be approved.
  Based on the details of your project and local IRB rules and procedures, your submission may result in a full IRB review and that approval letter would be attached to the DAUA.
