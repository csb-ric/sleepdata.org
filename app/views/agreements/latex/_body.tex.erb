  {\large DATA ACCESS AND USE AGREEMENT}
\end{center}

This Data Access and Use Agreement (the \textbf{``DAUA''}) is made by and
between The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., through its Division of Sleep
and Circadian Disorders (\textbf{``BWH''}) and
\hl{<%= latex_safe @agreement.data_user %>} (\textbf{``Data User''}). \\

\textbf{WHEREAS,} BWH is receiving support from the National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute (\textbf{``NHLBI''}) to establish and operate a web-based
collection of existing de-identified sleep study and related covariate data
originating from past NHLBI-funded research studies (the \textbf{``Data''}),
such collection known as the National Sleep Research Resource
(\textbf{``NSRR''}); and \\

\textbf{WHEREAS,} the purpose of the NSRR is to facilitate access to and use of
the Data by third-party researchers to conduct sleep research in accordance with
NHLBI and BWH policies and procedures (the \textbf{``Purpose''}); and \\

\textbf{WHEREAS,} to the extent permitted by its Institutional Review Board and
institutional policies, BWH wishes to make the Data, in the form of one or more
\textbf{``Datasets,''} available to Data User, and Data User wishes to receive
the Datasets, for this Purpose under the terms and conditions of access set
forth herein; \\

\textbf{NOW, THEREFORE,} in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
set forth below, the parties hereby agree as follows: \\


1. Data User is: \\

<% if @agreement.data_user_type == 'individual' %>
  An individual, requesting Data/Datasets under this DAUA on behalf of
  himself/herself as follows: \\

  \begin{addmargin}[1em]{1em}

2. Data User will describe to BWH via the electronic registration process for
  NSRR Data access at https://sleepdata.org the specific sleep research use for
  the Data / Datasets proposed by Data User (the \textbf{``Specific Purpose''}).
  The Specific Purpose as described in the online application process is: \\

  \begin{addmargin}[1em]{1em}
    \hl{\textbf{<%= latex_safe @agreement.title_of_project %>}} \\

    \hl{<%= latex_safe @agreement.specific_purpose %>} \\

    \begin{itemize}
      <% @agreement.datasets.each do |dataset| %>
        \item \hl{<%= latex_safe dataset.name %>}
      <% end %>
    \end{itemize}
  \end{addmargin}



For avoidance of doubt, permissible uses may include use of the Data / Datasets
for research evaluation and testing of a product or technology but will not
extend to proposals that include or incorporate the Data / Datasets into such
product. BWH will provide the Data / Datasets requested by the Data User upon
BWH's approval, in its sole discretion, of the Specific Purpose, its receipt of
this DAUA signed by Data User (or of Data User's Duly Authorized Representative,
if an organization), and the submission by Data User of any additional
information or documentation required by NSRR policies and procedures as
applicable to the request (including, when required, submission of evidence of
approval of the Specific Purpose by Data User's Institutional Review Board). The
requirements described in this Section 2 will apply regardless of whether Data
User has been previously approved by NHLBI to access complementary data from
databases or other resources controlled by NHLBI (including but not limited to
BioLINCC). Data User acknowledges that other researchers are permitted to
access the Data/Dataset on the same terms as Data User, so that duplication of
research may occur. \\

3. Any Data/Datasets provided to Data User under this DAUA will be De-Identified
within the meaning of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 privacy regulations (\textbf{``HIPAA''}). Data User agrees that Data User
will not attempt to identify or re-identify any individual patient/research
subject or group of patients/research subjects from the Data / Datasets. \\

4. Data User agrees that Data User will use the Data / Datasets solely for the
Specific Purpose and for no other purpose. Substantive modifications to the
Specific Purpose will require submission of an amendment to the original access
request and be subject to new approval pursuant to the process described in
Section 2. \\

5. Data User agrees that Data User will not disclose, disseminate, or otherwise
share the Data / Datasets to or with any other person or entity other than the
persons or entities identified to BWH on its application for NSRR Data access,
for any purpose, without the prior written consent of BWH. Data User will ensure
that any permitted third parties who are not under its direct control and who
will have access to the Data / Datasets agree in writing to all of the same
terms, conditions and obligations that apply to Data User with respect to the
Data / Datasets, and will make BWH a third-party beneficiary of such agreement.
For avoidance of doubt, although Data User may publish or present the results of
any research analysis conducted by it as part of the Specific Purpose, Data User
may NOT include the Data / Datasets, or any elements, parts or excerpts thereof,
in any publication or presentation without the express prior written consent of
BWH to such inclusion. \\

6. If the Data User determines that it is Required by Law (as that term is
defined in the HIPAA privacy regulations) to use or disclose the Data / Datasets
other than as provided for in this DAUA, it shall provide prompt written notice
of such determination to BWH so that BWH may have an opportunity to take
measures to protect the Data / Datasets as appropriate. \\

7. Data User will use appropriate safeguards, including information security
controls, to prevent use or disclosure of the Data / Datasets other than as
provided for by this DAUA, and Data User will report immediately to BWH in
writing any use or disclosure not provided for by this DAUA of which it becomes
aware. \\

8. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this DAUA as provided in
Section <%= @agreement.commercial? ? '14' : '12' %> below, the Data User shall
cease using the Data / Datasets and shall
destroy (or return if so requested by BWH) all of the Data / Datasets received
in tangible form, including notes, reports, and other information to the extent
it contains the Data / Datasets, and shall keep no copies, except to the extent
specifically Required by Law(s) made known to BWH by the Data User. \\

9. THE DATA / DATASETS AND ALL OTHER MATERIALS, TOOLS OR CONTENT ON
HTTPS://SLEEPDATA.ORG ARE PROVIDED ``AS IS.'' BWH MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, CONCERNING THE DATA/DATASETS OR
MATERIALS, TOOLS OR CONTENT, OR THE RIGHTS GRANTED HEREIN, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, AND THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS THE SAME. \\

10. IN NO EVENT SHALL BWH OR ANY OF BWH'S RESPECTIVE TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS,
OFFICERS, MEDICAL OR PROFESSIONAL STAFF, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS BE LIABLE TO THE
DATA USER FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS DAUA OR RIGHTS GRANTED
HEREIN, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ECONOMIC DAMAGES OR INJURY TO PROPERTY OR LOST PROFITS, REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER BWH SHALL BE ADVISED, SHALL HAVE OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT
SHALL KNOW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE FOREGOING. \\

<% if @agreement.commercial? %>
11. Data User shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless BWH and its affiliates
and their respective trustees, directors, officers, medical and professional
staff, employees, and agents and their respective successors, heirs and assigns
(the \textbf{``Indemnities''}), against any liability, damage, loss or expense
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of litigation) incurred by or
imposed upon the Indemnitees or any one of them in connection with any claims,
suits, actions, demands or judgments arising out of any theory of product
liability (including, but not limited to, actions in the form of contract, tort,
warranty, or strict liability) concerning any product, tool, technology, process
or service made, used, or sold or performed pursuant to any right granted under
this DAUA. Data User agrees, at its own expense, to provide attorneys reasonably
acceptable to BWH to defend against any actions brought or filed against any
party indemnified hereunder with respect to the subject of indemnity contained
herein, whether or not such actions are rightfully brought; provided, however,
that any Indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel, at the
expense of Data User, if representation of such Indemnitee by counsel retained
by Data User would be inappropriate because of conflict of interests of such
Indemnitee and any other party represented by such counsel. Data User agrees to
keep BWH informed of the progress in the defense and disposition of such claim
and to consult with BWH prior to any proposed settlement. \\

12. Data User shall maintain insurance sufficient to meet its obligations under
Section 11 of this DAUA. \\
<% end %>

<%= @agreement.commercial? ? '13' : '11' %>. Data User agrees not to use the name or logo of BWH or any of its affiliates
or any of their respective trustees, directors, officers, staff members,
employees, students or agents for any purpose without BWH's prior written
approval; provided, however, that Data User will acknowledge the NSRR as the
resource through which the Data / Datasets were obtained in any publication or
presentation arising from the Specific Purpose. At Data User's option, BWH may
post a summary of Data User's Specific Purpose and/or Data User's name on
https://sleepdata.org for the purpose of providing information about the
projects and users of the NSRR. \\

\begin{addmargin}[1em]{1em}
  <% case @agreement.posting_permission when 'all' %>

\end{addmargin}

<%= @agreement.commercial? ? '14' : '12' %>.
This DAUA shall become effective upon the date of BWH's release of Data /
Datasets to Data User (\textbf{``Effective Date''}) and shall expire upon the
earlier of (i) three (3) years after the Effective Date or (ii) Data User's
cessation or completion of the Specific Purpose (as applicable, the
\textbf{``Initial Term''}). If Data User continues to desire access to the Data
/ Datasets for the Specific Purpose beyond the Initial Term, Data User may
submit a request for continued access and an extension of this DAUA to BWH. BWH
may terminate the DAUA and Data User's access to Data / Datasets hereunder at
any time during the Initial Term or any subsequent term, and for any reason,
upon written notice to the Data User. \\

<%= @agreement.commercial? ? '15' : '13' %>.
To the extent Data User is permitted under the terms of this DAUA to retain
any portion of the Data / Dataset, or any copies thereof, upon the expiration or
termination of the DAUA, the Data User's obligations under the DAUA with respect
to such Data / Datasets shall survive such expiration or termination for as long
as Data User retains the Data / Datasets. \\

<%= @agreement.commercial? ? '16' : '14' %>.
This DAUA may be modified or amended only in a writing signed by duly
authorized representatives of both the Data User (where Data User is an
organization) and BWH. This DAUA shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Any claim or
action brought under this DAUA shall be brought in the federal or state courts
of Massachusetts. \\
