    About This Initiative

  %p
    Inspiratory flow limitation (IFL) is typically characterized by
    flattening on a nasal pressure transducer tracing which reflects a lack
    of increase in airflow despite increasing respiratory effort
    (Hosselet et al., AJRCCM 1998; 157:1461-1467). However, to date, IFL has
    been identified by subjective, and varying, criteria. There is some data
    demonstrating an association between IFL and transient arousals,
    suboptimal sleep architecture and possibly daytime hypersomnolence.
    Several methods have been described in the literature for assessing IFL
    based on visual detection of the nasal pressure transducer signal.
    Despite this lack of standardization and validation, studies using
    different manual and/or automated methods have reported an association
    between IFL and adverse outcomes.

    Objective

  %p
    A standardized approach to the visual assessment of IFL is necessary.
    As part of an ATS workshop project, we aim to determine the best
    approach to achieve a consensus-based algorithm to be used for scoring
    of IFL that can be disseminated and used to generate a validated
    training set of IFL breaths. This training set could also be used in the
    development of automated methods, which will be necessary for widespread
    acceptance of IFL as a physiological tool across large clinical
    datasets.

    How You Can Help

  %p
    We seek input from the sleep research community to help us better
    understand the visual characteristics that define IFL from the nasal
    pressure transducer airflow signal. Please take part in our online
    challenge (link below) and complete the following exercises on scoring
    airflow limitation in sample breath strips. This challenge will involve
    scoring flow limitation for 30, 60-second breath sequences. Moreover,
    we are interested in hearing from participants of the challenge on
    potential approaches or algorithms for defining IFL. Following
    completion of the challenge, there will be an opportunity for you to
    describe any novel approaches that you would like to share with us. The
    participant with the most innovative approach will be invited to join us
    at the ATS Workshop in Denver (Saturday May 16, 2015), with
    reimbursement for hotel and meals related to attending the workshop. We
    look forward to your input!
